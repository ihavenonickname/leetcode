# leetcode

Yeah, I know it's boring.

When I have some free time I solve leetcode problems. My language of choice is C, although that can change in the future.

All code is compiled with the following flags:

* [-std=c99](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html#cmdoption-clang-std)
* [-Werror](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#cmdoption-werror)
* [-Wall](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wall)
* [-Wpedantic](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wpedantic)
* [-Wconversion](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wconversion)

## How to run

Just call `./run.sh` passing the exercise name (i.e. its folder) as argument.

Example:

```sh
./run climbing-stairs
```

## Index

The folders are usually displayed in alphabetical order by your file system. Here's the list as per LeetCode's index order:

* [1. Two Sum](./two-sum/)
* [13. Roman To Integer](./roman-to-integer/)
* [14. Longest Common Prefix](./longest-common-prefix/)
* [20. Valid Parentheses](./valid-parentheses/)
* [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](./merge-two-sorted-lists/)
* [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](./remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
* [28. Implement strStr()](./implement-strstr/)
* [66. Plus One](./plus-one/)
* [69. Sqrt(x)](./sqrtx/)
* [70. Climbing Stairs](./climbing-stairs/)
